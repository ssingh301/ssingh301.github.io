*Due Date*: This Assignment is due on the date indicated on GitHub Classroom and/or Moodle. 

*Weight*: 15% of your overall grade.



## Getting Started

Download the .psd wireframe, required fonts, and marking rubric from Moodle.

Clone down a copy of this repository and begin developing locally. Remember to commit your changes and push up your revised files as you work. 



## Custom Font Hints

You can only define one variant of a font per `@font-face` rule. This means that if you have a medium and a bold weight, you will need two separate files and two rules.

Remember that you will need to use a custom (self-hosted) font, a Google Font, and a system font for this Assignment.

1. All of links in the header and footer become `--asparagus`.
